# Intel RDT Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive Intel Resource Director Technology (RDT) support for container-bench with proper separation of concerns between monitoring and allocation.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. RDT Monitoring (Per-Container)
- **Configuration**: `container[X].data.rdt: true/false`
- **Purpose**: Collects L3 cache occupancy and memory bandwidth metrics
- **Implementation**: Uses `goresctrl` library with monitoring groups
- **Data Collected**:
  - L3 cache occupancy (MB)
  - Memory bandwidth total (MB/s)
  - Memory bandwidth local (MB/s)
  - RDT class name
  - Cache utilization percentage

### 2. RDT Allocation (Scheduler-Level)
- **Configuration**: `scheduler.rdt: true/false`
- **Purpose**: Enables cache-aware scheduler to allocate cache resources
- **Implementation**: Creates RDT classes and moves processes between them
- **Features**:
  - Automatic threshold-based allocation (40% cache miss rate)
  - Consecutive measurement validation (3 samples)
  - Support for high-miss and low-miss resource classes

### 3. Separation of Concerns
- **Monitoring**: Controlled per-container via `data.rdt` flag
- **Allocation**: Controlled at scheduler level via `scheduler.rdt` flag
- **Independence**: Can monitor without allocation, or allocate based on monitoring
- **Flexibility**: Mixed configurations supported (some containers monitored, others not)

## Configuration Examples

### Monitoring Only
```yaml
scheduler:
  implementation: cache-aware
  rdt: false  # No allocation
container0:
  data:
    rdt: true  # Monitoring enabled
```

### Monitoring with Allocation
```yaml
scheduler:
  implementation: cache-aware
  rdt: true   # Allocation enabled
container0:
  data:
    rdt: true  # Monitoring enabled
```

### Mixed Configuration
```yaml
scheduler:
  implementation: cache-aware
  rdt: true   # Allocation enabled
container0:
  data:
    rdt: true  # Container 0 monitored
container1:
  data:
    rdt: false # Container 1 not monitored
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Monitoring Only (`rdt_monitoring_only.yml`)
- ✅ RDT monitoring initialized correctly
- ✅ Scheduler receives data but no allocation performed
- ✅ Logs show "monitoring only" mode
- ✅ L3 cache and bandwidth data collected successfully

### Test 2: Monitoring with Allocation (`rdt_with_allocation.yml`)
- ✅ RDT allocator initialized with available classes
- ✅ Containers allocated to RDT classes based on cache miss rates
- ✅ Full allocation capabilities enabled
- ✅ Scheduler makes allocation decisions

### Test 3: Mixed Configuration (`mixed_rdt_demo.yml`)
- ✅ Selective monitoring: only containers 0 and 2 monitored
- ✅ Container 1 has no RDT monitoring group
- ✅ Scheduler still has allocation capabilities for monitored containers

## Database Integration

All RDT metrics are exported to InfluxDB with the following fields:
- `rdt_l3_cache_occupancy_mb`
- `rdt_memory_bandwidth_total_mbps`
- `rdt_memory_bandwidth_local_mbps`
- `rdt_class_name`
- `rdt_cache_utilization_percent`

## Technical Details

### RDT Initialization Logic
- RDT is initialized if ANY container has `rdt: true` OR scheduler has `rdt: true`
- Single initialization serves both monitoring and allocation needs
- Proper cleanup on benchmark completion

### Cache-Aware Scheduler
- Supports both monitoring-only and allocation modes
- Constructor accepts allocation flag: `NewCacheAwareSchedulerWithRDT(threshold, hasRDTAllocation)`
- Conditional allocation logic based on flag setting
- Proper null checks and cleanup

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if RDT unavailable
- Proper cleanup of monitoring groups
- Timeout handling for monitoring operations

## Impact

This implementation provides container-bench with enterprise-grade cache management capabilities:

1. **Performance Analysis**: Monitor cache behavior of containerized workloads
2. **Resource Optimization**: Automatically allocate cache resources based on demand
3. **Interference Management**: Isolate noisy neighbors using cache allocation
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Support for monitoring-only or full allocation scenarios

The separation of monitoring from allocation allows users to:
- Start with monitoring to understand workload behavior
- Graduate to allocation-based optimization when needed
- Mix monitoring and allocation strategies as appropriate
