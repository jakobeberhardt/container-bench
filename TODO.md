# TODO
- Cache info in meta data, e.g. 3MB LCC, 1KB L1
- Env variables in .yml file
- Parallel start up and tear down
- ~~Bulk write to DBs~~
- RDT Memory/s Field: Use Delta
- ~~Add relative time~~
- Handle docker timeouts using context
- Preallocation of Dataframes according to sice, e.g. if sampling rate is different
- Start collectors faster and earlier (we want to see the cache warming up)
- Add support for container exit (e.g. when benchmark finished)
- Make perf counters count all cores
